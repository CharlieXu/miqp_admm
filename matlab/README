Matlab scripts that generate examples from paper "A Simple Effective
Heuristic for Embedded Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming" by 
Reza takapoui, Nicholas Moehle, Stephen Boyd, and Alberto Bemporad,
available at www.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/miqp_admm.html.
In order to compare the results of our heuristic to the global
solver Gurobi, CVX package (www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvx/) and a 
separate installation of Gurobi (http://www.gurobi.com/) is required.

solver_miqp_admm.m  -- the solver used in all examples. See comment headers.
syn.m -- randomly generated problems (synthetic data).
vehicle.m  -- hybrid vehicle control example. (Requires vehicle_data.m in the same directory.)
converter.m -- power converter control. (Requires converter_data.m in the same directory.)
comms.m -- signal decoding example.
